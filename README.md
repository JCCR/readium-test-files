readium-test-files
==================

Some ePub3 files used to demonstrate the capabilities of the Readium SDK and derived reading systems, particularly its ability to cope with both good and bad content.

### Important:

These files are intended to be representative of real-world ePub3 content. They are not designed to serve as examples of well-designed ePub3 content; rather they are likely to demonstrate the ability of the Readium SDK to handle *poorly* implemented content.
